            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve been very curious for as long as I could remember and for as long as I’ve known about the existence of computers I’ve always wondered about how they work and the machinations under which they operate. However, from the passive observations I made during the brief moments I’d encounter coders on the internet and get a glimpse into their technical worlds, I had quietly written off computer science as a career field for me to get into for the same reasons that I had written off mathematics in my early adolescence: while it was beautiful to see in action, it was a skillset I had deemed unattainable to me and as foreign as french. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by things you don’t understand. When I found out about Road To Hire, I was definitely eager to try it out but I was also unsure of if I was fit for the program. Even so, I figured I’d give it a try and before I knew it I was officially in. While I usually go with my gut, my intuition kept telling me I wouldn’t get far with every advancement I made. In spite of this, I kept putting my best foot forward and was gradually starting to get better than I had anticipated at coding which slowly but surely gave me a lot of confidence.
                <br>
                When I think of this, I think of a question that we’d been asked earlier in this program: Why do you think you deserve to be at Road To Hire? Simple answer? Because I want to be. Consciously and subconsciously.

            <h3>Road Talks Host</h3>
            <video src="trimmedvid.mp4" autoplay muted controls></video>
        </br>
            <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e54_gWSqVME0PS-TTysRpFjpbg91Msx1/view?usp=sharing" class="pa">See full May 20 Road Talk here!</a></strong>
            <p>I chose this work sample because I found this task to be thoroughly entertaining. While I was a bit nervous about how my public speaking skills would be received by my peers, I was definitely excited to host a Road Talk and choose a theme for everyone to abide by! </br>
                The main skills this assignment focused on from my perspective were public speaking, creative thinking skills (i.e. picking a theme and questions to ask the audience), and leadership skills for when we may have to lead a meeting in the workplace. </br>
                
                The most challenging aspect of this assignment for me was navigating unexpected events. For example, when I was hosting and I had announced a peer as the next speaker, this speaker had told me that they were not aware that they had to present a Road Talk speech on that day. That event had never happened before in the history of Cohort A Road Talks so I had to lean on Ay’Shya a bit to figure out how to pivot to the next speaker. Another challenge was making sure that my questions were open-ended enough for the vast majority of the room to be able to respond to them. I’d noticed a pattern with past hosts choosing a popular piece of media as a theme and those that were not familiar with that certain tv show, movie, etc not being able to engage in the discussion as much as those that were fans of said piece(s) of media so while I did give some contextual background in each question, I made sure that the questions themselves didn’t mention anything plot or character specific. Finally, my biggest archnemesis when it comes to public speaking seems to be pacing. I’m not someone who naturally speaks very slowly so enunciating every word when I speak really takes a conscious effort for me. That being said, I do feel like I spoke with clarity on that day. Comparing this to my photo backstory assignment where I was 20 seconds short of the 2 minute mark due to my pacing, I feel that I’m gradually getting better at taking my time when it comes to knowing what I want to say. </br>
                This assignment made me realize how much fun I have leading something and being in charge. It also made me reflect and realize that I’m gradually getting better at pacing myself and that I could really handle a leadership role if I applied myself. That being said, a goal I have for the remainder of this program would definitely be to take charge and seek out more leader-like positions as the program continues. I’d also like to be known for speaking up and advocating for others.

            <h3>E-Commerce Site</h3>
            <div class="worksample2">

            </div>
            <p>I chose this work sample because this was the project I was the most excited about. I had never made an E-Commerce website before so it felt like I was learning something very new which was cool to me as well as the fact that I would learn about it through hands-on work. I tend to see coding projects like this as fun ‘build-it-yourself’ DIY type assignments and I like the sense of pride I get knowing that I could build something from the ground up in a sense. </br>

                This assignment was pure HTML and CSS but we were allowed to incorporate JavaScript into our project if we chose to. </br>
                
                While this project was fun it definitely challenged my sense of time management and self discipline. I had mapped out time frames to work on it each day only to create the very basic semantic html elements the first day it was assigned to the cohort and then not really touch it until the weekend before it was due. I hate procrastinating like that because it doesn’t give me enough time to truly experiment with different html and/or css properties. It also made me second guess my confidence in my CSS skills as there were a few issues I had that took me more time to solve than I am willing to admit. While my CSS skills have grown from the Gateway project, there is still some more work to be done. Even so, I’m happy with my continuous growth in my coding abilities. </br>
                I want to make cleaner websites as I progress through the program in terms of CSS. This one looks pretty clean so I believe I am doing a good job so far. I definitely want to get better at building responsive websites too as my E-Commerce site wasn’t half as responsive as I wanted it to be. In spite of that, I definitely believe that I am halfway there. Try shrinking this site’s window down and you’ll see what I mean! </br>

            <h3>Overall...</h3>
            <p>My journey in the Road To Hire program has been progressive and steadfast. I learn 2-3 new things each week. Some of these things I wasn’t even aware that I didn’t know until they were brought to my attention. In recent weeks, I feel like I am starting to become more proud of the work I turn in because I can truly say that I believe I am trying my hardest and applying myself fully. And I love that feeling! Much like our personal brands, the codes we come up with individually seem to be unique fingerprints of our personalities. And I really feel that I can express myself through my code. </br>
                For me, Road To Hire means anticipating new beginnings, building a long and fruitful career alongside like-minded peers, and expecting the unexpected. </br>
               My biggest strength is my resourcefulness. Knowing how to navigate workspaces to find the information I’m looking for and being sure that I am making good use of the resources given to me has saved me in more ways than one. I feel that the ability to be resourceful leads to unlocking a lot of other strengths too i.e. self sufficiency, resiliency, and proactiveness. That being said, I can capitalize on this by making an example of myself and allowing my resourcefulness to give me the aura of a model employee during our upcoming interviews. </br>
               My biggest area of opportunity? Pacing. Not just in public speaking, but in life. Taking my time and learning to enjoy myself and just be in the moment. While I do like to experiment with things, sometimes I feel that I am wasting my life away by not moving meaningfully or with purpose at all times. I seem to have subconsciously learned that I am only allowed to move with intention and in a well thought out and calculated way that’ll lead to big achievements constantly and consistently throughout my life and that none of the little things matter. I don’t think I give myself much room to fail or be led to a ‘dead end’. I’m not sure exactly when I internalized such a mindset but I need to learn to calm down and take things one day at a time. I can’t rush my progress or my comprehension of technical languages and by understanding that I believe I can go far even with failures. Progress isn’t as linear as I want it to be and I have to come to terms with that. The easiest way I believe I can overcome this is honestly with some form of meditation. The practice seems to focus on the state of being and forces you to meet yourself where you are in the present.
